Auto-admin
==========
Auto-admin is a set of tools for automating common systems management tasks
such as enabling/disabling services, tuning the system, installing software,
etc.

There are two primary goals:

    * Provide a compatibility layer to help automate sysadmin tasks across
    multiple platforms.
    * Act as a knowledgebase for performing sysadmin tasks from the
    command-line. 

Core design principals:

    * Complete portability: Our aim is to support any POSIX platform for which
    someone is willing to maintain the code.
    * Zero dependencies: All scripts are written in POSIX Bourne shell and use
    only POSIX tools included with the base system.
    * Speed and Simplicity: Our efforts are focused on basic functionality,
    robustness, fast and easy setup and management.
