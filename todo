Make sure all man pages are in section 8

auto-update-system: Identify ports that cannot be packaged and rebuild
from source when necessary.  E.g. audio/lame

Eliminate all platform-specific directories and add platform checks
(auto-os-release) to each script that doesn't support all platforms.

Use sysrc to edit rc.conf?

auto-pkgsrc-setup
    Check for BSD compatibility in echo (fails on Ubuntu)
	Set sh to /bin/bash
    Don't ask about adding to path for all users unless running as root
    Set MAKE_JOBS in mk.conf (detect cores, ask user for limit)

auto-pxe-installer should back up root ssh keys

profile.d scripts should be 644

Set GATEWAY in sysconfig/network for PXE install?

auto-replace-file should take extension as third arg, otherwise use numbers

Clean ports after successful install

Rename auto-package-installed to auto-port-installed

soft quote all strings that might contain spaces

pkg_add should have option to specify version for cases like eigen/eigen2

Add to rc.suspend
    if fgrep amd_enable="YES" /etc/rc.conf; then
	/etc/rc.d/amd stop
    fi
    if fgrep moused_enable="YES" /etc/rc.conf; then
	/etc/rc.d/moused stop
    fi
    
Add to rc.resume
    if fgrep amd_enable="YES" /etc/rc.conf; then
	/etc/rc.d/amd start
    fi
    if fgrep moused_enable="YES" /etc/rc.conf; then
	/etc/rc.d/moused start
    fi

Scripts that enable amd, moused should re-run auto-set-suspend-on-lid
