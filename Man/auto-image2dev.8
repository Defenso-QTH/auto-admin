.SH DESCRIPTION

.B auto-image2dev
bit-copies a disk image to a writable storage disk device such as
a USB thumb drive.  All data on the device, including any existing
partition table, will be lost.

Note that this does not copy the file to the filesystem on the
device, but makes the device itself a copy of the file.

The --success-file option is useful when running auto-image2dev
from a GUI application through a terminal emulator, which typically
do not not pass back the exit status of the processes running under
them.

The image file should be a complete disk image containing one
or more filesystems, such as a .iso file, a macOS .dmg file,
or a FreeBSD .img installer image.

The device name can generally be determined by running dmesg
after connecting it.  On FreeBSD, device names are typically
da0, da1, etc.  On Linux and NetBSD, sd0, sd1, etc.  The device
name can be given with or without a /dev/ prefix.

.SH RETURN VALUES

0 on success, non-zero error code on failure
